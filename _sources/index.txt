Beautiful colormaps for oceanography: `cmocean <http://github.com/matplotlib/cmocean>`_
=================================================

This package contains colormaps for standardizing commonly-plotting oceanographic variables. Most of the colormaps started from `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ colormaps, but have now been adjusted using the `viscm tool <https://github.com/BIDS/viscm>`_ to be `perceptually uniform <http://bids.github.io/colormap/>`_.

Here is our gallery:

.. plot::
   :include-source:

   import cmocean
   cmocean.plots.plot_gallery()

These colormaps were chosen to be perceptually uniform and to reflect the data they are representing in terms of being sequential or divergent, and to be intuitive. For example, chlorophyll is represented by shades of green, turbidity is shades of brown, and temperature goes from cool blues to warm yellows.

Here is the lightness of the colormaps:

.. plot::
   :include-source:

   import cmocean
   cmocean.plots.plot_lightness()


It is probably better to think in cam02ucs colorspace, in which Euclidean distance is made to be equivalent to changes in human perception. Plots of these colormaps in this colorspace and with some other important properties are seen using the `viscm tool <https://github.com/BIDS/viscm>`_.

Here are some properties from the Salinity colormap. We can see that the colormap prints nicely to grayscale, has consistent perceptual deltas across the colormap, and good viewability for people with color blindness. It has a smooth representation in its 3D colorspace, and detail in the images is clear.

.. plot::
   :include-source:

   import cmocean
   cmocean.plots.wrap_viscm(cmocean.cm.salt)


All of the evaluations of the colormaps using the viscm tool are shown in the page :ref:`colormaps_viscm`.

Colormap details
----------------

CDOM
^^^^

The Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) colormap is sequential with whitish-yellow for low values and increasing in pink with increasing value to represent an increase in material in the water. Two examples of this colormap are shown below, from Texas A&M University gliders. Nicknames for this colormap are 'CDOM', and 'cdom', and the units are typically given as [mg/m^3].

Chlorophyll
^^^^^^^^^^^

The Chlorophyll colormap is sequential with whitish-green for low values and increasing in green with increasing value to represent an increase in this green material in the water. Two examples of this colormap are shown below, from Texas A&M University gliders. Nicknames for this colormap are 'chl', 'chloro', and 'chlorophyll', and the units are typically given as [mg/m^3].

Density
^^^^^^^

The Density colormap is sequential with whitish-blue for low values and increasing in purple with increasing value to represent an increase in water density. Two examples of this colormap are shown below, from Texas A&M University gliders. Nicknames for this colormap are 'density' and 'rho', and the units are typically given as [kg/m^3].

Free Surface
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Free Surface colormap is diverging with dark blue to off-white to dark red representing negative to zero to positive sea surface elevation, with deviations in the surface elevations as shades of color away from neutral off-white. Shades of red have been chosen to represent sea surface elevation above the reference value (often mean sea level) to connect with warmer water typically being associated with an increase in the free surface, such as with the Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico. An example of this colormap is from a numerical simulation of the Texas and Louisiana shelf. Nicknames for this colormaps are 'seasurface', 'freesurface', 'zeta', and 'eta', and the units are typically given as [m].

Oxygen
^^^^^^

The Oxygen colormap is sequential for most of the colormap, representing the normal range of oxygen saturation in ocean water, and diverging 80% of the way into the colormap to represent a state of supersaturation. The bottom 20% of the colormap is colored reddish to highlight hypoxic or low oxygen water, but to still print relatively seamlessly into grayscale in case the red hue is not important for an application. The top 20% of the colormap, after the divergence, is colored yellow to highlight the supersaturated water. The minimum and maximum values of this colormap are meant to be controlled in order to properly place the low oxygen and supersaturated oxygen states properly. This colormap was developed for the Mississippi river plume area where both low and supersaturated conditions are regularly seen and monitored. Examples of this colormap (without colorbar limits being controlled to set the values of the red and yellow regions) are shown from Texas A&M University gliders. Nicknames for this colormap are 'oxygen' and 'o2', and the units are typically given as [m/l].

Capabilities
------------

The colormaps are all available in ``cmocean.cm``. They can be accessed, and simply plotted, as follows:

.. plot::
   :include-source:

   import cmocean
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 3))
   ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 1)
   cmocean.plots.test(cmocean.cm.temp, ax=ax)
   ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 2)
   cmocean.plots.quick_plot(cmocean.cm.chl, ax=ax)

All available nicknames of the colormaps can be accessed with ``cmocean.cm.cmnames``:

.. ipython:: python

   import cmocean

   cmocean.cm.cmnames


The distinct colormap instances can be accessed with:

.. ipython:: python

   import cmocean
   
   cmaps = cmocean.cm.cmall;

Print all of the available colormaps to text files with 256 rgb entries with:

``cmaps = cmocean.cm.cmall``

``cmocean.tools.print_colormaps(cmaps)``

Output a dictionary to define a colormap with:

.. ipython:: python

   import cmocean

   cmdict = cmocean.tools.get_dict(cmocean.cm.cdom, N=9)
   print cmdict

Make a colormap instance with ``cmap = cmocean.tools.cmap(rgbin, N=10)`` given the rgb input array.
